sublime?

move all the history files into `~/.history.d`

bash should add the slash after a symlink to a directory by default

I'm debating running scripts automatically when I enter a directory, e.g. for development environment entry.
It's a definite vector for infection or just problems in general.
There are some mitigations: owned by me, only writable by me, on the same filesystem as the rc files are on.
Still, I don't know what'd actually be a secure way to do it.
Perhaps, for environments, I just hardcode what I want to happen.


vim stuff:
    comment/uncomment
    upper,lower,titlecase conversions (maybe even camel,snake,kebab conversion)
    colors I actually like (and fit my terminal)
    fuzzy agnostic autocomplete

use `vim -R` as a pager?
