# dotsync

Sync your dotfiles (or other utilities) using only:

  * ~100 sloc of POSIX sh as a framework
  * a folder for each set of dotfiles
  * a configuration file for each box you manage that has one folder name per line

Seriously, it doesn't take much to do this stuff.


## Usage

Use `bin/dotsync [BASE DIR]`, or make sure `bin/` is on your `PATH` and call simpy as `dotsync`.
The base dir should contain `boxen/` and `dotfiles/` (e.g. it could just point to this repository).
If it is omitted, then it defaults to `~/dotsync`.

You can also `source bin/dotfuncs`, and then call the functions `dotup`, `dotdown`, and `dotsync` manually (but why?).
Thankfully, there's only ~50 sloc in there, so go read the implementation as "documentation".


### Configuration

You may place a number of text files under `boxen/`.
The framework finds `boxen/$(hostname)`, so the file used for you machine is the one with the name name as the host.

Each of these files should have one module name per line.
See "Writing Dotfiles" coming up next for what a "module" is.
If a module doesn't exist, then a warning is emitted, but otherwise the framework carries on installing all the modules it can find (so, for example, putting `#` at the start of a line would probably make the module get skipped).

### Writing Dotfiles

The `dotfiles/` folder should only contain directories.
These are what I'm calling "modules".
Each module name here is what is referenced by the `boxen/*` configuration files.

Each module should have a file `install.sh`.
This file should define four functions:
  * `dotsync_depsgood` --- check that the dotfiles make sense on the system (i.e. don't install X11-related dotfiles if there isn't an X11 install on the system)
  * `dotsync_newest` --- check if the current install is up-to-date with what the module expects
  * `dotsync_setup` --- install from a fresh state
  * `dotsync_teardown` --- uninstall without fail, even if the module isn't currently installed

There's a script `lint.sh` that checks that the scripts in `dotfiles/` are written in particularly safe ways.
(Atm, this just means parameters substitution is always in brackets, and echos are always to stderr.)
